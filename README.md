# Personalized Feed Parser

This is a hobby project, don't judge :)

## Requirements to Run the Project

So far, you'll need:
- uv
- Python >=3.12
- NodeJS

Before starting you'll want to run `uv sync`.
When working on `app.ts` you should run `npm run dev`. To run the app in dev mode, use `fastapi dev main.py`.
